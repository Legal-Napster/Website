Legal Napster is legal because content available for download on the site has been marked by our owners as "directly funding an illegal cause" (ie. references to involvement in drugs, prostitution, driving while under the influence, and/or other descriptions of crime). We, the founders, contend that on this basis of both moral and legal conduct, such behavior, unless clearly stated to have taken place within an area where such behavior is legal, should not be funded by the public, because of its flaws, and therefore is open to be distributed freely.
